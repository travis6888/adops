                    <h1>AD OPTIMIZER</h1>
                    <p>This is an internal tool that will help increase productivity by decreasing the amount spent on sorting ad campaigns and individual ads</p>
                    <ul> Some important notes:</ul>
                        <li>This system only works with Excel workbooks, specifically the .xls format. The .xlsx format may work but is not guaranteed.</li>
                        <li>Files over 15mb's will break the system it seems, it is best to copy the clean ad report to a new workbook.</li>
                        <li>Make sure the formulae went all the way through the sheet from top to bottom for things like SU/IMP</li>

                        <li>To help make the program run smoothly it is best to copy & paste special values to the sheet you wish to parse. The copy and paste
                        will remove any formulae from the sheet.</li>

                        <li>Columns are represented as integers and column A starts at 0. Make sure to have the correct column location for each input, examples are A=0, J=9, etc.</li>
                        <li>You must label the sheet number too figure out which sheet to parse. The first sheet is 1, and continues normally from there.</li>
                        <li>Name the file anything you want, the file returned will only have one sheet and will be called adoptimization with todays date.</li>
                        <li>The page does not disappear and the download will happen automatically.</li>
                        <li>The input fields set floors to sort ads. SU's of 3 will make any ad sort ads with less than 3 differently than those with 3 or more.</li>
                    <li>There is multi stage sorting happening.</li>
                    <li> An example of a performing ad may have a click thru rate(CTR) >= 5%, SU/IMP >= 1%, Clicks >= 30 , Impressions >= 50, SU's >= 5.</li>
                    <li>So it best to set the input fields as according to your KPI's.</li>
                    <li>The reason to set SU, Clicks, and Impression floors is to make sort based on statistical significance. Ads with low amounts of data give skewed results. </li>
                        <li>CTR and SU/IMP need to represented in decimal form, .01 for 1%, etc.</li>
